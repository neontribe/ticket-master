Ticket Master
=============

To start would like to set of commands I can run on the command line that:

    1. Get a list of boards for a given user
    1. Get a list of 'columns' for a given user
    1. Get 'tickets' in a column
    1. Get 'comments' for a ticket
    1. Get attachments for a ticket

Then I would like to see a command/set of commands that let me build a local directory structure of:

    |
    +- Board
    |    +-- Column
    |    |      +- Ticket
    |    |      |    +- Comment
    |    |      |    +- Comment
    |    |      |    +- Comment
    |    |      |    +- Comment
    |    |      |    +- Attachment
    |    |      |    +- Attachment
    |    |      +- Ticket
    |    |      +- Ticket
    |    |      +- Ticket
    |    +-- Column
    |    +-- Column
    |    +-- Column
    |
    +- Board
    ...
